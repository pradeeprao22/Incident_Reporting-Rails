Assignment is completed fully as you asked, I didnt concentrate much on front-end since, it was taking to much time. But still it is user friendly.

Description:
I have created the model for district and it is connected to school model using associations, right now user can see districts but user can select school he/she is looking for.
I have used two models for form (landing page, detailed reporting) as i dont want to mix the incomplete froms(landing page) with detailed form, and i have used many gems while developing this module, you will find it in gem file at bottom. And you can find file uploads inside public/uploads.
